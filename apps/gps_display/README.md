## This is a simple GPS device connected to ESP32 wroom and a small sd1306 oled display

#### I had a spare ESP32 wroom sitting around and a GPS and so got some small OLED displays

#### Includes schematic

#### Current version is just GPS and the GT-U7 GPS is used, which seems to only get a signal OUTSIDE
